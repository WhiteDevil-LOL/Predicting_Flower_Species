---> PROJECT OVERVIEW :

This repository features a fundamental machine learning project focused on supervised learning, specifically classification. The objective is to build a model capable of classifying Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project is an excellent next step for beginners in machine learning to understand classification workflows, evaluation metrics, and gain practical coding experience.

---> OBJECTIVE :
>>>The primary objective of this project is to:

1.Understand Classification Workflow: Implement the typical steps involved in a classification problem.

2.Apply K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Use KNN, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, to categorize flower species.

3.Evaluate Classification Performance: Learn and apply appropriate metrics for classification tasks, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

4.Visualize Data for Insight: Understand how data visualization aids in comprehending class separability and feature relationships.

---> KEY CONCEPTS COVERED :

1.Supervised Learning: Training a model on labeled data to predict categories.

2.Classification: Predicting a discrete, categorical output (flower species).

3.Features (Independent Variables): Input measurements used for classification (e.g., sepal length, petal width).

4.Target (Dependent Variable): The categorical variable we aim to predict (e.g., 'setosa', 'versicolor').

5.Data Splitting: Dividing data into training and testing sets to assess generalization. stratify parameter is important for balanced class distribution in splits.

6.Model Training: The process where the algorithm learns patterns from the training data.

7.Prediction: Using the trained model to forecast categories for new, unseen data.

8.Model Evaluation: Quantifying the model's accuracy and performance using various metrics:

    Accuracy: Overall correctness.

    Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions for a class.

    Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives for a class.

    F1-Score: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

    Confusion Matrix: A table summarizing correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

9.Data Visualization: Using pairplot and scatter plots to explore feature relationships and class separability.

---> TECHNOLOGIES USED :

1. Python 3.x: The programming language.

2. Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

3. NumPy: For numerical operations.

4. Scikit-learn: The primary machine learning library for loading the Iris dataset, implementing KNeighborsClassifier, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.

5. Matplotlib: For basic plotting.

6. Seaborn: For enhanced statistical data visualization.
